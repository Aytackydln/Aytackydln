## What Do I do?
Most people know me as the maintainer of [Project-Aurora](https://github.com/Aurora-RGB/Aurora).
Secretly, in my daily life I'm a full stack developer.

I will share my most notable works here.

## Aurora-RGB (Project-Aurora)
https://github.com/Aurora-RGB/Aurora

I really liked the concept when I first used it.
Figured it could have some improvements, later I even became a contributor.

My changes include many bugfixes, some new features and most importantly performance improvements.
Aurora would have 100% usage on 1 thread in most cases. I reduced it to somehow 0% on my computer
(except screen reading, it is expectedly resource heavy).

## Artemis Plugins
[Artemis.MediaInfo](https://github.com/Aytackydln/Artemis.MediaInfo)

[Artemis Layout Generator](https://github.com/Aytackydln/Artemis-layout-generator)

[Artemis.Plugins.Games.Witcher3](https://github.com/Aytackydln/Artemis.Plugins.Games.Witcher3)

Well, Artemis is Aurora's competitor...
But I believe it will be better in the future, so I'm contributing here and there.

## Chat bot
https://github.com/Aytackydln/duyuruBot

This was a small project I wrote to notify me of new announcements my school made.
We were supposed to check many pages every day. I'm lazy so I just automated it :)
To also help my friends, I made it as a chat bot and everyone could customize their notifications.

This project was my sandbox for practicing and learning new technologies and techniques.
When I learned about hexagonal architecture, I transformed its architecture to quickly learn about it.

## 2D Game Engine
https://github.com/Aytackydln/BytecodeEngine_Old

Small, low feature game engine I did while I was studying Computer Engineering.
I've learned how games worked. Prioritized performance and low input lag.
Probably helped me optimize Aurora to its current level today.
